Mixins that are used universally, in all to most projects, are located in "Project Starter => Toolkit => Abstracts => Mixins".

Variables that are used in construction, scaffolding, or form the base of an algorithm are located in
"Project Starter => Toolkit => Abstracts => Variables => Core".

Functions that are used in construction, scaffolding, or form the base of an algorithm are located in
"Project Starter => Toolkit => Abstracts => Functions => Core".

For modularity purposes, any specific mixin, function, or variable is located with the its corresponding component; variable values are still controlled through the Theme Sheet, which should be loaded first to override all defaults.
